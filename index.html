					</a>
					<span class="details">Send Short Surveys Via Email</span>
					<h4></h4>
					<p><b>Summary:</b> Quick Survey is my first production ready app built using React, which I have spent some time learning since my graduation from General Assembly.  The purpose of the app is to allow users to send out short, 1 question surveys to respondents via email.  Responses are stored when respondents click on links in the email.</p>
					<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> In addition to React, the front end uses Redux, React Router, and Redux Form. The back end uses Node, Express, and MongoDB.  I also used Google’s OAuth for authentication, SendGrid for emailing, and Stripe for payments (test mode only).

					<span class="details">Map-Based Quiz Game</span>
					<h4></h4>
					<p><b>Summary:</b> For my capstone project at General Assembly, I created a map-based game using <a href="https://jqvmap.com/" target="_blank">JQVmap</a>.  The object of the game is to correctly identify the U.S. State on an unlabeled map based on the state name or state capital.  The user can select from several different options to make the game harder or easier (e.g., by allowing a different number of incorrect guesses or visually identifying which states have already been correctly guessed) as well as save progress for completion later.</p>
					<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the front end and Ruby on Rails for the back end.</p>

					<span class="details">Bucket List by U.S. State</span>
					<h4></h4>
					<p><b>Summary:</b> For the third project at GA, and only group project, my team and I created a bucket list application.  Although roles on the team were fluid with each group member making contributions on various aspects, I worked extensively on how data pulled from our API was displayed to the user and the ways in which the user would interact with that data.  I also reviewed our overall code base to make sure it was logically organized and followed semantic naming conventions.</p>
					<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the front end and Express/MongoDB for the back end.</p>

					</a>
					<span class="details">A Personal Movie Database</span>
					<h4></h4>
					<p><b>Summary:</b> Movie Night was my second project at GA and my first full-stack web application.  The app allows users to catalogue their personal movie collections and record data about each, from Title, Director, and Year Released to customized ratings, ownership status, and number of times watched.
						<p><b>Technologies Used:</b> I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars for the front end, and Ruby on Rails connected to a PostgreSQL database on the back end. The application connects to the excellent <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/" target="_blank">Open Movie Database</a>, allowing users to search and import movie meta data quickly and easily.</p>
